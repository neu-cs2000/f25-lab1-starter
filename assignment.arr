include image

# Problem 1
#| Use the given images of a head, eyes, nose, and mouth, and above and overlay-align functions to define a constant FACE 
that is an image with two eyes, a nose, and a mouth. |#

# Problem 2
#| Define a constant EAR and place two of them on your face, defining a new constant FACE-WITH-EARS. 
Note how in using a constant we only have to draw it once and get to use it twice! |#

# Problem 3
#| The face you created probably looks a bit like emojis that you are familiar with. 
We'd like you to think more about how you chose what to make yours look like, and to do so, introduce a technical term:

Representational Harm: when the identity of a person or group is misrepresented (e.g. perpetuating stereotypes or minimizing existence of a certain group).

INTERPRETIVE QUESTION: While you may have been limited by time, imagine you were able to perfect your face, 
and the result was adopted as the main reaction for Apple's iMessage (in addition to ‚Äº, üëç, üëé, ‚ô•, and "haha!"). 
Please explain, in 2-3 sentences, how there might be representational harms caused by this? |#
